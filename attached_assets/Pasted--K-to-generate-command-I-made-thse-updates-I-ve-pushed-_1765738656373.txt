I made thse updates. I've pushed a new update online so please reveiew the new functionality and features and lets give replt constructive feedback that is commcerially viable 

I can't browse the live site directly, but I can help you create a structured review feedback prompt for Replit based on everything we've built.
First, let me check what the current state of your local code looks like to ensure my feedback aligns with what's deployed:
I can see all our new components are in place (NetworkSwitchBanner.tsx, PendingTxBanner.tsx, usePendingTransactions.ts).
Here's a comprehensive feedback prompt for Replit based on our work and what's needed for commercial viability:
## POST-UPDATE REVIEW & NEXT STEPS FOR COMMERCIAL TESTINGI've implemented major updates. Please review the current state and help me address any remaining issues.---## WHAT'S BEEN IMPLEMENTED:### Core Functionality ✅- Live mint status display (MINTING LIVE / PAUSED / SOLD OUT / CLOSED)- On-chain verification before marketplace purchases (BuyButton security)- Activity feed with block timestamp caching- Governance quorum progress indicator- Network switch banner when on wrong chain- Pending transaction tracker with localStorage persistence### Data Accuracy ✅- useTotalSupply uses totalMinted() not totalSupply()- All hooks include chainId: 32323 for BasedAI- Network validation before all write transactions### Portfolio (Your Battalion) ✅- useOwnedNFTs hook calls tokensOfOwner(address)- Shows only REAL owned NFTs from blockchain- Empty state: "You don't own any Guardians yet"- Removed demo/mock data toggle buttons---## PLEASE REVIEW & FIX IF NEEDED:### 1. Check NetworkSwitchBanner is showing- Connect wallet on Ethereum mainnet- Verify red "WRONG NETWORK" banner appears at top- Test "SWITCH TO BASEDAI" button works### 2. Check PendingTxBanner is tracking transactions- The banner should appear in bottom-right when transactions are made- Verify transactions persist after page refresh- Test that status updates when tx confirms### 3. Check Portfolio shows real ownership- Connect wallet with 0 NFTs → Should show empty message- Connect wallet with real NFTs → Should ONLY show owned tokens- No mock/demo NFTs should appear### 4. Check Mint section- Verify live mint count from contract- Verify mint status badge (LIVE/PAUSED/etc.)- Verify remaining supply shows correctly- Verify price is 69,420 $BASED### 5. Check Marketplace- BuyButton should show "VERIFYING..." before allowing purchase- Already-sold items should show "SOLD" button- On-chain price should be used, not cached price### 6. Check Governance- Quorum progress bar should appear on each proposal- Shows "X / Y votes (Z% required)"- Green bar when quorum met, yellow when not---## REMAINING TASKS FOR COMMERCIAL READINESS:### High Priority:1. [ ] Test all transaction flows with real $BASED on BasedAI mainnet2. [ ] Verify error messages are user-friendly (not raw contract errors)3. [ ] Test on mobile devices (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)4. [ ] Remove any remaining console.log debug statements### Medium Priority:5. [ ] Add confirmation modal before high-value transactions (>10,000 $BASED)6. [ ] Improve loading skeleton animations7. [ ] Add "My Listed NFTs" filter in marketplace8. [ ] Add price history chart for marketplace items### Low Priority:9. [ ] Add social sharing for minted NFTs10. [ ] Add email/notification alerts for offers received11. [ ] Add transaction history page---## SPECIFIC BUGS TO CHECK:1. Does the app crash if RPC is slow/unavailable?2. Does wallet disconnect mid-transaction show proper error?3. Does refresh during pending transaction maintain state?4. Are all images loading from IPFS correctly?5. Does infinite scroll in Collection work without errors?---## MOBILE TESTING CHECKLIST:Test on 375px width (iPhone SE size):- [ ] Navbar hamburger menu works- [ ] Mint buttons are full-width- [ ] Marketplace cards stack nicely- [ ] Modals are scrollable and closeable- [ ] Wallet connect works- [ ] Toast notifications are visible---Please review each section and let me know what's working and what needs fixes. Focus on anything that would prevent a real user from completing a transaction successfully.
Copy this to Replit! It gives them clear direction on what to test and what to prioritize for commercial readiness. 🎯
Want me to also create a specific bug-fix prompt if you notice any issues when testing the live site?
you can't review the site from this link 
based-cyber-d-app--ryanbonelli.replit.app
 

You're right - I can't visually browse or interact with the live site. The web search didn't return any usable content from that URL.
Here's what I CAN do:
Review your local code in Cursor to check for issues
Help you test by telling you exactly what to check
Fix bugs you describe to me
Would you like to:
A) Tell me what you're seeing when you test the site? (What works, what doesn't, any errors?)
B) Have me do a deep code review of specific files to catch potential issues?
C) Get a detailed testing script you can follow yourself and report back?
For quick wins right now, you could:
Open the site in Chrome DevTools (F12) → Console tab
Tell me if there are any red errors showing
Connect your wallet and tell me what happens in the Portfolio section
What would be most helpful?
I am giving you all of the currenbt files and code so you can do a proper assessment and review and give me replit ready prompts to imporve the sites commercially readiness and functionality

Here's your comprehensive Replit prompt to fix all remaining issues:
## COMMERCIAL READINESS FIX: Remove Remaining Mock Data & PolishI've done a code review and found these issues that need fixing for commercial testing:---## ISSUE 1: MARKETPLACE USES MOCK PRICES (Critical)In `client/src/components/EscrowMarketplace.tsx`, the marketplace is adding FAKE prices to all items.### Fix Location 1: Remove mock price generation (around line 329-337)FIND this code:return data.pages.flatMap((page: any) => page.nfts).map((item: any) => ({   ...item,   isListed: true, // Assume all fetched are listed for this demo   // Mock price: Make some items (e.g., every 3rd one) have NO price to test the "Offer" state   price: item.id % 3 === 0 ? undefined : 420 + (item.id % 100),    currency: '$BASED',   owner: `0x${item.id.toString(16).padStart(40, '0')}` // Mock owner})) as unknown as MarketItem[];REPLACE WITH:return data.pages.flatMap((page: any) => page.nfts).map((item: any) => ({   ...item,   isListed: false, // Will be updated by real marketplace data   price: undefined, // Real price comes from useListing hook   currency: '$BASED',   owner: item.owner || undefined})) as unknown as MarketItem[];### Fix Location 2: Remove mock receivedOffers (around line 90-93)FIND:const [receivedOffers, setReceivedOffers] = useState([    { id: 1, nftId: 300, nftName: "Guardian #300", offerer: "0x71C...9A21", amount: 450, time: "2 hours ago", status: "pending" },    { id: 2, nftId: 1245, nftName: "Guardian #1245", offerer: "0xA4F...B299", amount: 1200, time: "1 day ago", status: "pending" }]);REPLACE WITH:// Real offers will come from blockchain events - empty for now until we implement offer trackingconst [receivedOffers, setReceivedOffers] = useState<any[]>([]);---## ISSUE 2: REMOVE DEBUG CONSOLE LOGS (49 statements)Search the entire `client/src` folder for console.log, console.warn, console.error statements.Keep ONLY these types:- console.error for actual errors that should be tracked- Remove all console.log debug statementsFiles with most logs to clean:- EscrowMarketplace.tsx (14 logs)- smartFetcher.ts (7 logs)- useGuardians.ts (5 logs)- PoolTracker.tsx (4 logs)- onchain.ts (5 logs)Either delete them or wrap in a debug flag:const DEBUG = false; // Set to false for productionif (DEBUG) console.log('...');---## ISSUE 3: CLEAN UP MOCK IMPORTSIn files that still import MOCK data but don't need it:### NFTGallery.tsx - Line 7CHANGE:import { Guardian, MOCK_GUARDIANS, calculateBackedValue, RARITY_CONFIG } from "@/lib/mockData";TO:import { Guardian, calculateBackedValue, RARITY_CONFIG } from "@/lib/mockData";Also remove the `useMockData` and `useCsvData` state variables if they're no longer used.### Hero.tsxCheck if MOCK_GUARDIANS import is still needed. If not, remove it.---## ISSUE 4: MARKETPLACE "BUY" TAB SHOWS ALL NFTsThe marketplace currently shows ALL NFTs with fake "for sale" status. It should only show NFTs that are actually listed on the marketplace contract.Add this logic to filter by real listings:// In EscrowMarketplace.tsx, after getting activeListingIds from marketplace hookconst listedTokenIds = new Set(marketplace.activeListingIds?.map(id => Number(id)) || []);// Filter allItems to only show actually listed NFTsconst listedItems = allItems.filter(item => listedTokenIds.has(item.id));Then use `listedItems` instead of `allItems` in the Buy tab.---## ISSUE 5: ADD EMPTY STATE FOR MARKETPLACEWhen no NFTs are listed for sale, show a proper message:{listedItems.length === 0 && (  <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center py-20 border border-dashed border-white/10 rounded-xl bg-white/5">    <ShoppingBag className="w-16 h-16 text-muted-foreground mb-4" />    <h3 className="text-xl font-orbitron text-white mb-2">NO ACTIVE LISTINGS</h3>    <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">No Guardians are currently listed for sale.</p>    <p className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">Be the first to list yours!</p>  </div>)}---## ISSUE 6: POOLTRACKER MOCK DATAIn `client/src/components/PoolTracker.tsx`, there are 15 mock/demo references.Review and replace mock staking data with:- Real staking contract data if available- Or clear messaging that "Staking feature coming soon"---## TESTING AFTER FIXES:1. [ ] Connect wallet with 0 NFTs → Portfolio shows "You don't own any Guardians"2. [ ] Marketplace Buy tab → Shows "No Active Listings" (since nothing is listed yet)3. [ ] Marketplace Offers tab → Shows "No Active Offers" 4. [ ] No console.log spam in browser DevTools5. [ ] All prices show as real contract values, not fake numbers---## SUMMARY OF CHANGES:1. ✅ Remove mock prices in marketplace2. ✅ Remove mock receivedOffers  3. ✅ Clean up 49 console.log statements4. ✅ Remove unused MOCK_GUARDIANS imports5. ✅ Filter marketplace to show only real listings6. ✅ Add proper empty states7. ✅ Clean up PoolTracker mock data

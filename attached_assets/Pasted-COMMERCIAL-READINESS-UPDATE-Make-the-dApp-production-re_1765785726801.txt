COMMERCIAL READINESS UPDATE - Make the dApp production-ready.

=== PART 1: CRITICAL - UPDATE CONTRACT ADDRESSES ===

Find constants.ts (or wherever contracts are defined) and update with these FINAL addresses:

// Core Contracts
export const NFT_CONTRACT = "0xaE51dc5fD1499A129f8654963560f9340773ad59";
export const MARKETPLACE_CONTRACT = "0x2836f07Ed31a6DEc09E0d62Fb15D7c6c6Ddb139c";

// Revenue Splitters  
export const MINT_SPLITTER = "0x371c67FE6e839F921279FcdD7dCb1Fd74eeD1d76";
export const ROYALTY_SPLITTER = "0xc87C7A5BA2A58bb7BB16799804582BA6C2E43279";

// Ecosystem Wallets
export const COMMUNITY_TREASURY = "0xae543104fdbe456478e19894f7f0e01f0971c9b4";
export const ROYALTY_WALLET = "0xb1362caf09189887599ed40f056712b1a138210c";
export const CREATOR_WALLET = "0xef2015bffe3e7db1474d5df99435fd8e936bac7a";

// Chain Config
export const CHAIN_ID = 32323;
export const RPC_URL = "https://mainnet.basedaibridge.com/rpc/";

IMPORTANT: Search and remove ALL references to old marketplace:
- 0x88161576266dCDedb19342aC2197267282520793 (OLD - REMOVE)
- 0xaf13b369189be79e5b5f5e9072648f1b4621b6a2 (V1 - REMOVE)

=== PART 2: MARKETPLACE V2 FEATURES ===

The V2 marketplace is APPROVAL-BASED (like OpenSea):
- NFTs stay in owner's wallet when listed
- Only transfers when sold
- Requires setApprovalForAll before first listing

Ensure the app:
1. Checks if user has approved marketplace before listing
2. Shows "Approve Marketplace" button if not approved
3. After approval, shows "List for Sale" button
4. Listed NFTs show "LISTED" badge but stay in Portfolio
5. Owner can delist at any time

=== PART 3: USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS ===

1. TRANSACTION STATES:
   - Show "Confirming..." while waiting for wallet signature
   - Show "Processing..." with TX hash while mining
   - Show success/error message when complete
   - Persist pending transactions across page refreshes

2. ERROR HANDLING:
   - Parse contract revert reasons into human-readable messages
   - Common errors: "Not enough $BASED", "Not the owner", "Already listed", "Not approved"
   - Show helpful suggestions for each error

3. GAS LIMITS:
   - Add explicit gas limits to all contract calls (BasedAI network needs this)
   - Approve: 200000
   - List/Delist: 300000
   - Buy: 500000
   - Mint: 500000

4. LOADING STATES:
   - Show skeleton loaders while fetching NFTs
   - Show loading spinners on buttons during transactions

=== PART 4: ACTIVITY FEED ===

Make activity feed show accurate real-time data:
1. Total Minted: Call totalSupply() on NFT contract (not event counting)
2. Recent Sales: Query NFTSold events from marketplace
3. Recent Listings: Query NFTListed events from marketplace
4. Show prices in $BASED with proper formatting

=== PART 5: WALLET CONNECTION ===

Ensure these wallets work:
- MetaMask (desktop & mobile)
- Rabby
- Coinbase Wallet
- WalletConnect

Add network auto-switch:
- If user is on wrong network, show banner to switch to BasedAI (32323)
- Include "Switch Network" button that triggers wallet switch

=== PART 6: PORTFOLIO ===

Portfolio should show:
1. All NFTs owned by connected wallet (from tokenOfOwnerByIndex)
2. Listed NFTs with "LISTED" badge and price
3. Quick actions: List, Delist, Transfer
4. Refresh button to reload NFT data

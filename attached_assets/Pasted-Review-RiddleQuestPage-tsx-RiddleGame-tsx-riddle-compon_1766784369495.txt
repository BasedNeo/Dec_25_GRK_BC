Review RiddleQuestPage.tsx, RiddleGame.tsx, riddle/* components, and server/routes.ts. Audit current chatbot integration (OpenRouter allenai/olmo-3.1-32b-think:free with OPENROUTER_API_KEY from secrets).

Current issues:
- Exact answer required (e.g., "$Based" only — no "Is it Based?" or variations).
- No question/hint responses (predetermined clues only).
- Mobile UI complicated (tabs, buttons cramped, hard to tap).

Fix and optimize for progressive, mobile-first experience:

1. **Chatbot Integration (Free OpenRouter)**:
   - Ensure /api/riddle/* routes call OpenRouter with system prompt:
     "You are Guardian Oracle. Evaluate answers semantically (accept 'Based', 'Is it Based?', '$Based', etc.). For questions/hints: Give lore-themed hint. Concise responses."
   - Limit: 3 interactions/session (sessionStorage 'oracleQuestions').
   - Fallback: Static riddles if API error/rate limit.
   - Params: max_tokens=150, temperature=0.6.

2. **Flexible Answers/Questions**:
   - API parses user input: If question ("hint?"), return hint. If answer, validate semantically.
   - Accept variations (e.g., synonyms, casual phrasing) via chatbot.
   - UI: Single input field for answer/question, "Submit" button.

3. **Mobile-Optimized UI** (Simplify):
   - Single tab view (Campaign/Daily toggle button, not tabs).
   - Large input field (full width), prominent Submit button.
   - Progress: Simple bar (1/5 riddles), stats below.
   - Portrait-first: Stack vertically, touch-friendly (48px min buttons).
   - Dark cyberpunk theme, neon accents.

4. **Game Flow**:
   - Continue from Level 2 (550 points, streak).
   - Campaign: Sequential riddles.
   - Daily: 5 riddles, streak bonus.
   - Points: 10/riddle, 50/challenge complete.

Preserve points economy (Ore Points only).

Plan first:
- List files/lines to modify.
- Test cases: Semantic answer ("Is it Based?"), question ("hint?"), mobile taps.
- Performance: 60 FPS, <2s load.

Approve, implement step-by-step. Test full campaign/daily on mobile emulator, confirm chatbot flexibility, no exact-match.

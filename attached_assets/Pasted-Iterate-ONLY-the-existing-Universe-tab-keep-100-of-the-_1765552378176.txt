Iterate ONLY the existing "Universe" tab — keep 100% of the current cyberpunk neon design, parallax background, layout, colors, fonts, animations, header ("WELCOME TO BASED GUARDIANS (BETA)"), main "# The Based Universe" section, interactive buttons ("CONNECT WALLET" and "MINT NOW"), "MISSION TIMELINE" structure, and the four thematic blocks (Humanitarian Horizon, Galactic Storytelling, Infinite Possibilities, Guardian Exchange) completely intact. Do NOT rebuild or change any existing elements — only enhance with better flow, the video, updated timeline, and polished copy for commercial engagement (FOMO, CTAs, mobile readability).

1. **Hero Enhancement** (keep existing header and main section structure):
   - Update main "# The Based Universe" text to: "The Based Universe: A Saga of Guardians, Frogs, and Creatures" (neon cyan heading, purple subheading).
   - Below it, add the full lore blurb (white, centered, line-height 1.6, natural wrap):  
     "Step into the Based Guardians Universe, a space crafted with care for those who cherish crypto trading and NFT collecting. Here, $BASED L1 tokens mint 3,732 unique NFTs—1,776 Guardians, 1,320 Frog Wranglers, and 636 Creatures—blending creativity with opportunity. As Guardians stand against the shadows of FUD, your NFTs become part of a privacy-focused cosmos where holding unlocks simple, meaningful rewards. Join us in building a legacy that whispers among the stars.

     The Heartbeat of an Ancient World
     Beneath the galaxy's canopy, the FUD cyborg fowl—mechanical harbingers with ember-like eyes—cast shadows over the Brain Network, their origins a riddle lost to time. These foes challenge the stalwart Guardians, whose 32 lineages trace their lineage to celestial battles, and the Based Frogs, whose 7 clans guard secrets of bio-engineered symbiosis with the 7 broods of fearless Creatures. Wizard Committer, a sage of silver beard and star-threaded staff, once mapped the Based-Bridge, his disappearance a puzzle that fuels our ongoing saga. Basedgod, crafted by Jehovah Jireh, the one true God, looms as the divine architect, his golden robes a silent promise of balance across this sprawling cosmos.

     A Legacy Secured by Vision
     Rooted in a secured subnet, our realm leverages the potential of Based Labs' infrastructure when ready yet stands independent of its fate. For years to come, this project will thrive on-chain as our sole beacon of activity if need be—we own its destiny.

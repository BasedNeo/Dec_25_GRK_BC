Iterate ONLY the "Universe" tab — keep 100% of the current cyberpunk design, parallax background, layout, animations, colors, fonts, and all other tabs/features completely untouched. Do NOT change or add anything outside the Universe tab.

Update the Universe tab with this exact, rich, lore-driven content:

**Hero Section** (full-width, subtle parallax deep-space background with slow-moving stars and faint nebula — low CPU, non-distracting):
- Large neon-cyan heading: The Based Universe
- Subheading (purple): A Father-Daughter Saga of Guardians, Frogs, and Creatures

**Lore Blurb** (white, centered, readable, line-height 1.6, natural wrap):
"Step into the Based Guardians Universe, a space crafted with care for those who cherish crypto trading and NFT collecting. Here, $BASED L1 tokens mint 3,732 unique NFTs—1,776 Guardians, 1,320 Frog Wranglers, and 636 Creatures—blending creativity with opportunity. As Guardians stand against the shadows of FUD, your NFTs become part of a privacy-focused cosmos where holding unlocks simple, meaningful rewards. Join us in building a legacy that whispers among the stars.

The Heartbeat of an Ancient World
Beneath the galaxy’s canopy, the FUD cyborg fowl—mechanical harbingers with ember-like eyes—cast shadows over the Brain Network, their origins a riddle lost to time. These foes challenge the stalwart Guardians, whose 32 lineages trace their lineage to celestial battles, and the Based Frogs, whose 7 clans guard secrets of bio-engineered symbiosis with the 7 broods of Creatures. Wizard Committer, a sage of silver beard and star-threaded staff, once mapped the Based-Bridge, his disappearance a puzzle that fuels our 14-chapter saga. Basedgod, crafted by Jehovah Jireh, the one true God, looms as the divine architect, his golden robes a silent promise of balance across this sprawling cosmos.

A Legacy Secured by Vision
Rooted in a secured subnet, our realm leverages the potential of Based Labs’ infrastructure when ready, yet stands independent of its fate. For years to come, this project will thrive on-chain as our sole beacon of activity if need be—we own its destiny. As NFTs powered by smart contracts, these Guardians, Frogs, and Creatures hold the promise of evolving in myriad unforeseen ways, their long-term value blossoming with the creativity of their holders. Joining our community today is like stepping into the ranks of the founding fellowship, a chance to leave your mark with creative contributions that shape this enduring legacy—a hopeful bond that grows with every passing star.

A Gentle Note of Understanding
As you step into the Based Guardians Realm, we invite you with open hearts to explore this father-daughter crafted universe.

Your participation is a cherished part of this tale—thank you for joining us with understanding and hope."

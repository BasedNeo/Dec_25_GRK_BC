Design a complete, cyberpunk-themed DApp called "Based Command App" for the Based Guardians NFT series on the Base blockchain, inspired by the minimalist, dark UI of Cybrs.xyz/mint. Use React with Vite for fast development, Tailwind CSS for styling (black background, neon cyan and purple accents, monospace fonts like Orbitron for headers), RainbowKit for multi-wallet connect (MetaMask, WalletConnect, Rainbow, etc.), Wagmi and Viem for blockchain interactions, Alchemy SDK for NFT fetching and metadata, and Ethers.js for contract calls. The app should be responsive for mobile/desktop, load in under 2 seconds, and scale for 300-1000 users with batched queries to avoid RPC limits. Anyone can view public data (e.g., supply counters, pool balance) without connecting; connected users get personalized NFT display, values, and voting.
Structure the app as a single-page application with these sections:

Header: Fixed top bar with "Based Guardians" logo (bold, neon-cyan, glitch animation), right-side "Connect Wallet" button (RainbowKit, show shortened address/ENS after connect). Include a disconnect option.
Hero Section: Animated placeholder NFT carousel (use sample IPFS images or neon placeholders for guardians), live supply counter ("Minted: X / 3732"), mint button ("Mint 1 Guardian - 69,420 $BASED"), quantity selector (1-10), and transaction status modal (success confetti, error retries). On mint, 51% of proceeds (35,404 $BASED per NFT) auto-transfers to community pool wallet. Use contract ABI for mint function.
NFT Gallery Section: When wallet connected, fetch and display user's Guardian NFTs in a responsive grid (image from IPFS metadata, title, traits). Count total owned NFTs (for voting power: 1 NFT = 1 vote). Show series total: 3732. Include loading spinner and error handling (e.g., "No NFTs found").
NFT Value Estimation Section: Calculate base value per NFT as community pool $BASED balance divided by 3732 (series total). Display "Estimated Value per NFT: Y $BASED". For connected user, show per-NFT value, then total for their holdings (multiply by count). Add placeholder for rare NFTs: Boost value by 30% for specific token IDs (e.g., array of rares; initially empty, comment for future update). Fetch pool balance real-time via Ethers balanceOf call on $BASED ERC-20 contract. Update on connect or refresh button.
Voting DAO Section: Admin (hardcoded wallet or Ownable check) can propose initiatives via input form (description field, submit button triggering 'propose' on Governor contract). Display active proposals in a list (ID, description, vote counts: For/Against/Abstain). Connected users can vote (buttons: For/Against/Abstain; weight = NFT count). Use Governor ABI for propose/castVote; fetch proposals via event logs or TheGraph subgraph query. Show user's vote power. Non-connected: View-only mode.
Community Pool Tracker Section: Real-time display of $BASED balance in pool wallet (e.g., "Community Pool: Z $BASED"). Note: Starts with 51% mint proceeds, grows via staking emissions/royalties. Use Ethers for balance query; refresh button or interval (every 30s).
Footer: Social links (X/Discord icons), contract addresses (NFT, Governor, $BASED – clickable to Basescan), "Powered by Base" badge.
Placeholders: Use env vars for NFT_CONTRACT, GOVERNOR_CONTRACT, BASED_TOKEN, POOL_WALLET, ALCHEMY_KEY, WALLET_CONNECT_ID. Include testnet toggle (Base Sepolia for dev). Error handling: Modals for disconnected wallet, insufficient funds, tx failures. Security: No private keys; read-only for views. Optimize for 1000 users: Use react-query for caching, debounce fetches. Deploy-ready for Vercel/Netlify. Generate all code, including ABIs and components

Start → Show "TAP TO START" or "PRESS SPACE"
↓
Playing → Enemies spawn, player shoots, score increases
↓
Hit by enemy → Lose 1 life, brief invincibility
↓
Lives = 0 → Game Over screentiplier for consecutive hits
- Screen shake on explosions (subtle)
- Satisfying hit effects

STEP 5 - VISUAL DESIGN:

- Dark space background with stars
- Player ship: simple but cool (triangle or small spaceship)
- Enemies: distinct shapes, maybe colored by type
- Bullets: bright cyan or green laser
- Explosions: brief particle burst
- UI: Score top-left, Lives top-right, clean and readable

STEP 6 - AUDIO:

- Shoot sound: short "pew" 
- Hit sound: satisfying "boom"
- Player hit: alarm/warning sound
- Game over: dramatic but short
- All sounds SHORT (under 1 second)
- Mute button visible

MOBILE REQUIREMENTS:
- Works in PORTRAIT mode (phone held normally)
- Game fits on screen without scrolling
- Controls at bottom of screen
- Touch targets at least 60px wide
- No "rotate your phone" messages

GAME 2: RING GAME
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Rebuild as a simple timing game that WORKS.

CONCEPT: Rings rotate. Tap when gaps align. Simple.

STEP 1 - CORE MECHANICS:

// Basic structure:
- 2-3 concentric rings on screen
- Each ring has a gap (opening)
- Rings rotate at different speeds
- Player taps when gaps line up
- Correct = score + next ring pattern
- Wrong = lose a life
- 3 lives totalSTEP 2 - CONTROLS:

DESKTOP:
- Click anywhere = attempt alignment
- OR Spacebar = attempt alignment

MOBILE:
- Tap anywhere on screen = attempt alignment
- Entire game area is touch target
- Must be INSTANT response (no delay)

TEST: Do rings appear? Do they rotate? Does tapping work?

STEP 3 - TIMING LOGIC:

// When player taps:
if (gaps are aligned within 30 degrees) {
  // SUCCESS - award points
  score += 100;
  showFeedback("PERFECT!");
  nextLevel();
} else if (gaps are aligned within 60 degrees) {
  // OKAY - smaller points
  score += 50;
  showFeedback("GOOD");
  nextLevel();  
} else {
  // MISS - lose life
  lives--;
  showFeedback("MISS");
  if (lives <= 0) gameOver();
}STEP 4 - PROGRESSION:

- Level 1-3: 2 rings, slow rotation
- Level 4-6: 2 rings, medium rotation
- Level 7-10: 3 rings, medium rotation
- Level 11+: 3 rings, fast rotation
- Display current level prominently: "RING 7"

STEP 5 - VISUAL DESIGN:

- Dark background, minimal distractions
- Rings: glowing cyan/purple outlines
- Gaps: brighter color or different style
- Level number: LARGE, top center
- Lives: hearts or dots
- Feedback text: "PERFECT!" / "GOOD" / "MISS"
- Clean, focused, zen-like aesthetic

STEP 6 - AUDIO:

- Tap sound: subtle click
- Perfect: bright "ding!"
- Good: softer chime
- Miss: low buzz
- All sounds SHORT
- Mute button

MOBILE REQUIREMENTS:
- Works in PORTRAIT mode
- Rings fit on screen with padding
- Tap anywhere works
- No rotation required

GAME 3: CYBER BREACH
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Rebuild as a simple hacking puzzle game that WORKS.

CONCEPT: Match patterns or type codes to "breach" the system.

STEP 1 - PICK ONE SIMPLE MECHANIC:

OPTION A - MEMORY MATCH (Recommended for mobile):
- Grid of cards with symbols
- Flip two cards, find matches
- Match all pairs to complete breach
- Timer adds pressure
- Works great on mobile with taps

OPTION B - SEQUENCE REPEAT (Simon Says):
- Buttons light up in sequence
- Player repeats the sequence
- Sequences get longer
- Miss = lose progress or life

OPTION C - TYPING (Desktop only):
- Words appear on screen
- Type them correctly
- Speed typing challenge
- (Harder to do well on mobile)

RECOMMEND OPTION A for best mobile experience.

STEP 2 - CORE MECHANICS (Option A - Memory Match):

// Basic structure:
- 4x4 grid of cards (16 cards, 8 pairs)
- Cards start face-down
- Tap to flip a card
- Tap second card to try match
- Match = cards stay revealed
- No match = both flip back
- Match all = level complete
- Timer counts down (90 seconds?)
- Time runs out = game overSTEP 3 - CONTROLS:

- Tap/click on card to flip it
- That's it. Simple.
- Cards should be big enough to tap (min 60x60px)

STEP 4 - GAME LOOP:

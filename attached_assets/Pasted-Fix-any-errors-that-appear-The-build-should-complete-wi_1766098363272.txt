Fix any errors that appear. The build should complete with zero TypeScript errors.
Task 2: Production Build Test
Build the application for production:
build
npm run build
Expected outcome:
Build completes successfully
No warnings about circular dependencies
Bundle sizes are reasonable
Check the generated bundle sizes:
js
ls -lh dist/assets/*.js
Ideal sizes:
Main bundle: < 500KB
Vendor bundle: < 1MB
Individual route chunks: < 200KB each
If bundles are too large, investigate and optimize.
Task 3: Security Audit
Check for npm security vulnerabilities:
audit
npm audit
Fix any high or critical vulnerabilities:
fix
npm audit fix
If there are vulnerabilities that can't be auto-fixed, document them and assess if they affect the application.
Task 4: Check for Unused Dependencies
depcheck
npx depcheck
Remove any unused dependencies:
>
npm uninstall <package-name>
Task 5: Verify Environment Variables
Ensure .env.example contains all required variables that exist in the actual .env file (without the actual sensitive values).
Add any missing variables to .env.example with placeholder values:
your_value_here
# Example formatVITE_YOUR_NEW_VAR=your_value_here
Task 6: Create .gitignore (if not exists or incomplete)
Ensure .gitignore includes:
/
# Dependenciesnode_modules/# Build outputdist/build/# Environment.env.env.local.env.*.local# Logs*.lognpm-debug.log*yarn-debug.log*yarn-error.log*# Editor.vscode/.idea/*.swp*.swo*~# OS.DS_StoreThumbs.db# Testingcoverage/# Misc.cache/.temp/
Task 7: Verify Critical Files Exist
Ensure these documentation files were created:
ARCHITECTURE.md
DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md
CHANGELOG.md
README.md (updated)
.env.example
.gitignore
Task 8: Create Backup Timestamp
Create a simple backup marker file at the root:
File: LAST_BACKUP.txt
.

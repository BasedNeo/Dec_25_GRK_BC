- Guardian Command Center label at bottom
- Glowing missile trails (color-coded)
- Expanding explosion rings with particle effects
- Screen shake on impacts

- getGameConfig from '@/lib/gameRegistry'
- GameHUD, VictoryScreen components
- Lucide icons: Play, Shield, Info, ChevronRight, Volume2, VolumeX, Home, Loader2, Trophy, Zap, Target, Flame, Star

CONSTANTS:
- CANVAS_WIDTH = 800
- CANVAS_HEIGHT = 600
- GROUND_Y = 550
- Battery positions: [100, 400, 700] all at GROUND_Y
- City positions: [200, 300, 500, 600] all at GROUND_Y - 20
- MISSILES_PER_BATTERY = 10
- EXPLOSION_MAX_RADIUS = 60
- 10 waves with config: wave 1: 5 missiles at speed 60, wave 10: 30 missiles at speed 120

GAME STATE:
- wave (1-10)
- score
- batteries (3 with missiles, position, reloading status)
- cities (4 with position, active status, health)
- enemyMissiles array
- defensiveMissiles array
- explosions array
- particles array
- chainReactions counter
- accuracy tracking

RENDER LAYERS (back to front):
1. Sky gradient (indigo to purple)
2. 3 layers of parallax stars (different speeds)
3. Shooting stars (occasional)
4. 3 layers of alien mountains (purple gradients)
5. Ground layer (dark gradient)
6. Cities (green buildings with windows)
7. Batteries (blue with Guardian logo)
8. Enemy missile trails and heads (colored)
9. Defensive missile trails and heads (cyan)
10. Explosions (expanding rings with glow)
11. Particles (debris)
12. Command Center label

Implement complete game loop with:
- Missile movement (lerp from start to target)
- Collision detection (missiles in explosion radius)
- Chain reaction system
- Wave spawning logic
- Battery reload system
- Victory/defeat conditions

Add complete audio system with Web Audio API:
- launch: 800Hz → 400Hz over 0.15s
- explosion: 200Hz → 50Hz over 0.4s
- chain: 400Hz → 800Hz over 0.2s
- hit: 100Hz held for 0.3s
- wave: chord progression (400, 500, 600, 800 Hz)
- death: 400Hz → 50Hz over 0.8s

Include full start screen with:
- Guardian Defense title with cyan gradient
- How to Play section
- Missile types display (green/red/yellow with point values)
- Stats display if games played > 0
- START DEFENSE button
- Sound toggle
- NFT/wallet requirement checks

Include game screen with:
- Canvas with tap-to-fire controls
- GameHUD showing score, wave, cities alive, missiles remaining
- Chain reaction counter (when active)
- Exit button

Integrate with VictoryScreen component on game end showing:
- Final score
- Wave reached
- Accuracy percentage
- Max chain reaction
- Play Again and Exit buttons

Ensure mobile-responsive, 60fps performance, and full integration with GameStorageManager.

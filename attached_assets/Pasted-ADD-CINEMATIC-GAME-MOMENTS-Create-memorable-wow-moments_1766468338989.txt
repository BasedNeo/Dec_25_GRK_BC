ADD CINEMATIC GAME MOMENTS
Create memorable "wow" moments:
CREATURE COMMAND:
Wave 1 start: "WAVE 1" zooms in dramatically, then fades
Boss incoming: Screen dims, "⚠️ WARNING ⚠️" flashes, boss enters slowly
Final hit on boss: Slow-motion explosion (0.5s), then normal speed
High score beaten: Fireworks particle explosion, "NEW RECORD!"
RING ALIGNMENT:
Game start: Rings materialize from particles, spinning into place
Perfect hit: Time freezes (0.2s), particles burst, then continues
Ring 10 reached: "ADEPT UNLOCKED" banner slides in
Ring 20+: Background transforms (nebula intensifies)
CYBER BREACH:
Mission start: "INITIATING BREACH..." typewriter text
Last pair remaining: Timer flashes, tension music
Breach complete: "ACCESS GRANTED" with matrix effect
Speed run: "LIGHTNING BREACH! +500 BONUS"
These moments make players feel like heroes.

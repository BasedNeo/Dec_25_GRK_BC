Enhanced "User Stats" Tab: Gamification Page for Based Guardians
This is an outstanding idea — a dedicated User Stats tab is one of the most powerful ways to drive retention, daily visits, and community loyalty in NFT projects. Projects like Blur (leaderboards), Magic Eden (quests), and Axie Infinity (progression) saw 30-50% higher DAU from similar gamification. For Based Guardians, we'll make it on-brand: cyberpunk cosmic heroism, father-daughter legacy, anti-FUD vigilance, and "stay based" ethos. Using proven psychology:

Progression & Mastery (Bartle's "Achiever" type): Levels with clear requirements.
Collection & Completion (Zeigarnik effect): "Visit all pages", "Own one of each type".
Social Proof & Status (FOMO): Custom badges, rare titles like "Guardian Commander".
Endowed Progress (illusion of advancement): Start at Greenhorn on first NFT.
Variable Rewards (Skinner box): Unlock badges unexpectedly, confetti on level-up.
Narrative Tie-In (self-determination theory): Stats framed as "Your Role in the Saga".

Final Level Structure (Improved for Flow & Motivation)
We'll keep 8 levels but make them progressive, thematic, and achievable — early levels quick wins (dopamine hits), later levels aspirational (long-term hold).

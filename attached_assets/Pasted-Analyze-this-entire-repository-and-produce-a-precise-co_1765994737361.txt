Analyze this entire repository and produce a precise, complete, and neutral project scope document intended to be consumed by ChatGPT (GPT-5-Codex) alongside the full codebase.

This document will serve as the authoritative description of the system.
ChatGPT will be instructed to treat it as ground truth.



HARD RULES




This is READ-ONLY
❌ Do NOT suggest improvements
❌ Do NOT propose refactors
❌ Do NOT modify or rewrite logic
❌ Do NOT infer roadmap or future intent
❌ Do NOT speculate beyond what is present in the code
If something is unclear, explicitly state “unknown”



Your role is documentation and scope definition only.



REQUIRED OUTPUT (USE THESE HEADINGS EXACTLY)





1. System Overview




What the application does at a high level
Primary goals and responsibilities
Who the users are





2. Core Functional Domains




Voting systems
Gameplay mechanics
Rewards / play-to-earn logic
Leaderboards and rankings





3. Architecture & Components




Frontend (frameworks, responsibilities)
Backend/services (APIs, workers, schedulers)
Blockchain layer (contracts, events, indexing)
Data persistence and caching





4. On-Chain vs Off-Chain Responsibilities




What logic is enforced on-chain
What logic is handled off-chain
Source of truth for critical state





5. Data & State Flow




How data enters the system
How state is updated and consumed
How leaderboard or aggregate data is derived





6. Trust, Security, and Authority Boundaries




What components must be trusted
What components are intentionally untrusted
Authentication / authorization boundaries





7. Performance Characteristics




High-frequency execution paths
Gas-sensitive or cost-sensitive operations
Areas sensitive to scale or user growth





8. Critical Invariants (Must Never Break)




Voting integrity assumptions
Reward calculation assumptions
Gameplay rules the system relies on





9. External Dependencies & Integrations




Blockchains
Wallets
APIs
Oracles or third-party services





10. Known Constraints & Intentional Tradeoffs




Simplifications visible in the code
Areas optimized for speed vs safety





11. Explicitly Out of Scope




Features not implemented
Non-goals inferred from the codebase





WRITING STYLE




Neutral, professional, enterprise-grade
Descriptive, not evaluative
Clear enough for a senior engineer or AI auditor to reason from





FINAL REQUIREMENT



Write this document as if any incorrect assumption could cause a production incident.
Accuracy is more important than completeness.

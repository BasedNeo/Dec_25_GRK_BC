Iterate the existing Based Command App — keep 100% of the current cyberpunk neon design, layout, colors, fonts, animations, header, hero, lore, timeline, features grid, footer, and all tabs/features (Mint, Gallery, Voting, Collection, Pool, Universe, Saga Guide) completely intact. Do NOT rebuild or change any existing elements, tabs, or functionality outside the Arcade section.
Update the Arcade section (assumed existing game hub, accessible via a button or tab) with the following changes, ensuring no disruption to the app’s core functionality:

Remove Riddle Quest from Header and Burger Menu:
Delete any reference to "Riddle Quest" in the header navigation or hamburger menu. Ensure it is only accessible within the Arcade.

Hide Specific Games:
Hide the following games from the Arcade UI without deleting their code (preserve for future refinement):
Guardians Solitaire
Asteroid Mining
Ring Game

Implement hiding by adding a hidden=true flag to their respective game components or wrapping them in a conditional render (e.g., if (!hidden) { renderGame() }), ensuring no runtime errors or broken dependencies.

Update Arcade Game List:
Reorder and limit the visible games to the following three, listed as the only playable options:
Riddle Quest (first option, top position)
Creature Command (second option)
Retro Defender (third option, last position)

Each game card should maintain the current cyberpunk neon style (cyan borders, neon titles, hover glow) and include a brief description:
Riddle Quest: "Solve cosmic riddles to unlock the Based Universe. 2 plays/day."
Creature Command: "Lead your Creatures in battle. 10 plays/day."
Retro Defender: "Defend the galaxy retro-style. 10 plays/day."


NFT Ownership Requirement:
Require a connected wallet holding at least one Guardians NFT to access and play games in the Arcade.
Check ownership via balanceOf(walletAddress, tokenId) on VITE_NFT_CONTRACT (use Ethers.js).
If no NFT owned: Display "Own a Guardian NFT to play" (cyan popup, dismissible) and lock Arcade UI.

Daily Play Limits (Reset Every 24 Hours):
Implement a 24-hour play limit per game, resetting at 00:00 UTC daily (tracked via localStorage or Replit DB with timestamp).
Limits:
Riddle Quest: 2 plays/day
Creature Command: 10 plays/day
Retro Defender: 10 plays/day

On limit reached: Show "Play limit reached — try again tomorrow" (cyan message, 10s cooldown) with remaining time counter (e.g., "Resets in 23:45").
Use a simple counter per wallet address: increment on play, reset if timestamp > 24h old.

Riddle Quest Game Mechanics (Detailed Buildout):
Header: "Riddle Quest" (neon cyan, bold).
Intro: "Embark on a cosmic journey solving riddles. 2 plays/day."
Gameplay: Display one riddle from a pre-defined list of 33 (see below), cycled randomly per play.
Input: Text field (cyan border, max 100 chars) for answer submission.
Feedback: Correct = confetti + "Passage unlocked!" + 10 points; Wrong = "Try again" + hint after 2 fails.
Levels: Progress bar (0-100% per play, 50% per correct answer).
End: After 2 plays, lock with limit message.

Pre-Defined 33 Riddles (JS const array, 11 levels of 3):
Level 1: "I am the token mined from rare ore..." (based / $based)
Level 2: "How many Brain-Planets exist..." (1024)
Level 3: "Who is the official X handle..." (@getbasedai)
[Continue with all 33 from previous message, e.g., Level 4: "How many total NFTs..." (3732), up to Level 11: "The number of Creature broods..." (7)]

Creature Command Game Mechanics (Placeholder with Limit):
Header: "Creature Command" (neon cyan).
Intro: "Lead your Creatures in epic battles. 10 plays/day."
Gameplay: Placeholder — display a static battle scene with 3 Creature icons (user to provide assets). On click, simulate victory (confetti, +5 points).
Limit: Lock after 10 plays with "Limit reached" message.

Retro Defender Game Mechanics (Placeholder with Limit):
Header: "Retro Defender" (neon cyan).
Intro: "Defend the galaxy retro-style. 10 plays/day."
Gameplay: Placeholder — show a pixelated ship (user asset) with FUD enemies. Click to "shoot" (confetti, +5 points).
Limit: Lock after 10 plays with "Limit reached" message.

General Arcade Polish:
Add a "Play Count" display per game (e.g., "2/2 plays left" for Riddle Quest).
Use localStorage to track play counts and reset timestamps.
Mobile: Stacked game cards, touch-friendly buttons, full-screen modals.
Loading: Spinner "Loading Arcade..." on entry.


Secure: Read-only NFT checks, no server calls. No errors; test with connected wallet (0 NFTs → locked, 1 NFT → playable with limits).

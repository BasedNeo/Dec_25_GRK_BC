You have already built a fully functional Based Command App on the BasedAI chain (Chain ID 32323) with minting, wallet connect, supply counter, tabs, and basic metadata loading.

NOW execute every single remaining commercial requirement in one perfect iteration:

1. **Chain & Token**
   - Force the app to run ONLY on BasedAI mainnet (Chain ID 32323, RPC https://mainnet.basedaibridge.com/rpc/, symbol BASED, explorer https://explorer.bf1337.org/)
   - ALL prices, balances, and mint costs must display in $BASED (never ETH) by default
   - Add a small toggle button in header “View in ETH” that converts using a simple 1 ETH = 50,000 $BASED placeholder rate

2. **Full Metadata Sync (3732 Guardians)**
   - Load the uploaded CSV data/guardians-metadata.csv as the primary source (3732 rows)
   - Use Papa Parse to read it at runtime
   - For every NFT (Gallery + Sales tab), show ALL 13+ attributes in an expandable accordion (Character Type, Rarity Level, Speed, Agility, Intellect, Strength, Special Meta, etc.)
   - Fallback to live IPFS only if CSV fails
   - Add “Load More” + infinite scroll so ALL 3732 load without lag

3. **NFT Value Calculation**
   - “Backed by” value = community pool $BASED balance ÷ 3732 per NFT
   - +30% boost if Rarity Level = "Rare", "Epic", or "Legendary"
   - Show clearly: “Backed by X $BASED per NFT (+30% rare boost) | Your Total: Y $BASED”

4. **Marketplace / Sales Tab (Premium)**
   - Full searchable/sortable grid of all 3732 NFTs
   - Sorting: Price low→high, NFT number, Rarity Level, Strength, Intellect, any trait
   - Search bar that filters by any trait (e.g. “Strength 9+”, “Based Frog”, “Elite Guardian”)
   - Listings: forever or timed (seller chooses), cancel anytime
   - Buy with native $BASED only (no wrapped ETH)
   - Counter-offers: buyer can bid lower → seller accepts/rejects
   - 1% platform fee on every sale (sent to pool)

5. **Voting DAO**
   - Admin-only propose (VITE_ADMIN_WALLET = 0xAe543104fDBe456478E19894f7F0e01f0971c9B4)
   - Options: Yes/No or A/B/C/D + expiration timer
   - Votes weighted by NFT count
   - Clear note: “Votes are advisory — final decision by admin”

6. **Security & Commercial Polish**
   - ReentrancyGuard + Ownable on all contracts
   - Input sanitization everywhere
   - Confetti on mint + successful sale
   - Google Analytics (VITE_GA_ID)
   - “BETA” ribbon + version v1.0
   - Footer disclaimer: “Values are estimates. Actual market price may differ (e.g. Aftermint.trade). Not financial advice. Advisory votes only.”
   - Mobile-first responsive (test on phone)
   - Ready for Vercel deploy (no Replit-specific code)

Do everything above in one go. Keep current cyberpunk design. Test with real wallet connect. No errors in console.

This is the final commercial version — make it perfect.
